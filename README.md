Hello :)

I made everything in blueprints because it was faster, hope that is fine. 

You fly around and shoot the gold cube.

The shoots change color, the more infront the more red, the more above the more blue.

I use AABB to check collision. 
There is a problem with the future prediction, I only predict the future position for the shoots. 
Was less noticeable until I added noise to the cube lerping.
Would be quite hard to predict now even if I wanted to. 

Thanks for reading :)
